# Neural networks
The project includes a neural network for human motion recognition.
The UCI HAR file dataset contains the dataset used in the experiments for both training and testing.
The Deep Learning Neural Netowrks folder contains the neural network code, result image folders, and an image with comparable overall results.
Implemented with Python = 3.7 and used the following:
GRU, LSTM techniques
