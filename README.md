# Computational-Intelligence-and-Statistical-Learning-

3 different projects were implemented
Each of them includes different data classification techniques:
Support Vector Machine
K-Nearest-Œùeighbor
K-Nearest-Centroid

Dimension reduction with PCA, LDA

Finally, the clustering method was used in the same data


In each project there are folders for each dataset, with the code in Python 3.7 and the images with the results of the experiments.
