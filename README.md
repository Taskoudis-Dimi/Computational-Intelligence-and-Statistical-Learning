# AI - Computational Intelligence and Statistical Learning

In this project, there are 2 main parts. 
* The [first](TrainedModels) part was created, having completed some experiments on different data and creating some AI algorithms.
* The [second](WebApp) part was then created to allow a user to test each algorithm separately on the data.
