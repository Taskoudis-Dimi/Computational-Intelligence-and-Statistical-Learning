# AI - Computational Intelligence and Statistical Learning

In this project, there are 2 main parts. 

## First Part
The first includes applied Machine Learning (Supervised and Unsupervised), Reinforcement Learning algorithms, and Deep Learning models which are as follows:
* Classification
* Clustering
* Regression
* CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
* DQN (Reinforcement Learning)

## Second Part
The second part includes a web application, written in the Python Flask framework, which integrates all the first part's models to make them applicable to the user. 
What one needs to do to explore this app is the following:
* installation of all necessary libraries
```pip install -r req.txt``` 
* running application 
```python Flask.py```
* open the following address in the browser 
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
